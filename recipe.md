1) Take a slice of bread in a plate
2) Take some mozzerella cheese, shred it and put it on the bread
3) Take chillies, cut them and put them in the bread
4) Add salt 
5) Add any preferable sauce to it, I like ketchup
6) Put it in an oven for 2-3 mins(till cheese melts)
7) Voila, your homemade pizza bread is ready to be feasted upon!
